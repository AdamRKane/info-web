# Backend:

Originally this site was hosted on a Raspberry Pi Zero W (ARM6) running DietPi OS and a Nginx http/https server, and I may yet return to that setup following similar environmental sentiments as seen at [solar.lowtechmagazine.com](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/).
Until then it is on a much more powerful, and power hungry, server that hosts various software tools I use on a regular basis. See the bottom of this page for a more detailed list of what softwares I am running.

Server Specs:

	Hardware:

		CPU: Ryzen 5 3600X

		RAM: 32GB DDR4

		Storage: 500GB Samsung 980 M.2 SSD (Expanding this will likely be the next upgrade)

		GPU: NVIDIA 730 (I hope to upgrade this for Machine Learning soon)

		Motherboard: Asrock B550 Phantom Gaming 5 4/ac

		Power Supply: EVGA 650 G2 (80 Plus Gold)

	Software:

		OS: Ubuntu x64

		Containerization: Docker

		Reverse Proxy: Nginx

		HTTP(S) Server: Nginx

# Frontend:

# Other Server Software:

	Nextcloud - private file hosting, calendar, and card based task management

	Sharetex - collaborative online LaTeX editor from Overleaf (not currently running)

	JupyterLab - server based academic tool using python and markdown (great for machine learning and data analysis/visualization)

	Minecraft - duh

	IRAY Render Server - not yet added but will be when I upgrade the gpu on this system

I want this list to grow.
